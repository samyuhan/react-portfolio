## Description
This application was created to showcase my portfolio using React. There are 4 sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The portfolio section displays 6 of my best projects and assignments that link to the deployed site and GitHub repo. You can use the form to contact me (though it does not work at the moment). You can take a look at my resume and skillset.

## Technology
This app was built using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and React!

## Installation
